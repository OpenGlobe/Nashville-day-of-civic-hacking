# Nashville Day of Civic Hacking
Here's a shortlist of esources for the federal recreation projects during the National Day of Civic Hacking.  

# Challenge: How can data make access to the outdoors more equitable?
Poor user interfaces for outdoor recreation only introduce new barriers to underserved populations already battling inequity. How can we overcome socioeconomic and geographic challenges facing urban communities trying to access public lands?

Research suggests time in nature is an important component of physical, social, and mental wellbeing, but also that various barriers to access disproportionately impact urban communities. By making open spaces, parks, and public lands easier to reach and explore, more citizens can be part of the benefits that these lands afford society.

Transform droves of data about America's public lands into tools to drive new planning and policy or integrate models into applications that break down the inequities facing socially and economically underserved communities.

Increasingly, computational tools are becoming a part of how we understand and approach our great outdoors. Through a better understanding of the interactions between individuals and their natural environment, we can inform novel data-driven, cost-effective, and citizen-centric approaches.

#Resources
[The Recreation Information Database (RIDB)](http://usda.github.io/RIDB/) is the API for federal recreation areas.
The [Integrated Resource Management Applications Portal (IRMA)](https://irma.nps.gov/Portal) is the home of National Park Service data, including planning processes and biodiversity.
The U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service hosts comprehensive [geospatial data](http://www.fws.gov/gis/data/national/) describing parks and ecosystems.
The Bureau of Land Management [GeoCommunicator](http://www.geocommunicator.gov/GeoComm/) hosts overviews of the administrative status of BLM areas and other federal lands.
[HIFLD geospatial data](https://hifld-dhs-gii.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets?group_id=3885011b3b38424092b7dadb1c77a4f6) on state, county, urban, and various other political boundaries, including those for federal lands and national forests, collected on the Esri ArcGIS data storytelling platform.
